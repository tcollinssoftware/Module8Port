How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

	User needs are parsed at meetings with users and or clients/stakeholders at meetings between Product Owner and the external party. These needs are then reformatted and looked at logically to turn into user stories, which allow us to break down the ideal into what is hoped to be achieved by the end user, and how, along with what priority and complexity each story is.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

	I used to approach development from a waterfall methodology, as it was the only thing I had ever put to use. Since this course, however, I have already adapted sprints into my work, as well as a kanban board.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

	Being a good team member means carrying your own weight, being open and transparent, and willing to work together efficiently to make progress as a whole, delivering the best product to the client while meeting their needs with the least wasted time and effort.
